abstract = {Consider a model with parameter θ = (ψ,λ), where ψ is the parameter of interest, and let L(ψ,λ) denote the likelihood function. One approach to likelihood inference for ψ is to use an integrated likelihood function, in which λ is eliminated from L(ψ, λ) by integrating with respect to a density function π(λ|ψ). The goal of this paper is to consider the problem of selecting π(λ|ψ) so that the resulting integrated likelihood function is useful for non-Bayesian likelihood inference. The desirable properties of an integrated likelihood function are analyzed and these suggest that π(λ|ψ) should be chosen by finding a nuisance parameter φ that is unrelated to ψ and then taking the prior density for φ to be independent of ψ. Such an unrelated parameter is constructed and the resulting integrated likelihood is shown to be closely related to the modified profile likelihood.},

title = {Integrated likelihood inference in multinomial distributions},
abstract = {Consider a random vector (N1, N2, … , Nm) with a multinomial distribution such that E(Nj;θ)=npj(θ), j= 1 , … , m, where p1, ⋯ , pm are known functions of an unknown d-dimensional parameter, satisfying p1(θ) + ⋯ + pm(θ) = 1. This paper considers non-Bayesian likelihood inference for a real-valued parameter of interest ψ= g(θ) , for a known function g, using an integrated likelihood function. The integrated likelihood function is constructed using the zero-score expectation (ZSE) parameter, proposed by Severini (Biometrika 94:529–524, 2007); thus, the integrated likelihood function has a number of important properties, such as approximate score- and information-unbiasedness. The methodology is illustrated on the problem of inference for the entropy of the distribution.},

abstract = {Non-Bayesian inference regarding a parameter of interest in the presence of a nuisance parameter may be based on the integrated likelihood function, in which the nuisance parameter is eliminated by averaging the likelihood function with respect to a weight function for the nuisance parameter. Recent research has shown that integrated likelihood methods work particularly well when the model is reparameterized in terms of a nuisance parameter chosen to be “unrelated” to the parameter of interest and the corresponding weight function for this nuisance parameter is chosen so that it does not depend on the parameter of interest. One choice for such a nuisance parameter is the zero score expectation (ZSE) parameter. The purpose of this note is to extend the definition of the ZSE parameter to the case in which the model has a parameter vector θ, with the parameter of interest of the model taken to be a function of θ; that is, the definition of the ZSE parameter is extended to the case in which there is not an explicit nuisance parameter for the model. The resulting integrated likelihood function has the same desirable properties as integrated likelihoods based on the ZSE parameter in models with an explicit nuisance parameter.},

@book{severini2000,
title = "Likelihood Methods in Statistics",
abstract = "This book provides an introduction to the modern theory of likelihood-based statistical inference. This theory is characterized by several important features. One is the recognition that it is desirable to condition on relevant ancillary statistics. Another is that probability approximations are based on saddlepoint and closely related approximations that generally have very high accuracy. A third aspect is that, for models with nuisance parameters, inference is often based on marginal or conditional likelihoods, or approximations to these likelihoods. These methods have been shown often to yield substantial improvements over classical methods. The book also provide an up-to-date account of recent results in the field, which has been undergoing rapid development.",

abstract = {Elimination of nuisance parameters is a central problem in statistical inference and has been formally studied in virtually all approaches to inference. Perhaps the least studied approach is elimination of nuisance parameters through integration, in the sense that this is viewed as an almost incidental byproduct of Bayesian analysis and is hence not something which is deemed to require separate study. There is, however, considerable value in considering integrated likelihood on its own, especially versions arising from default or noninformative priors. In this paper, we review such common integrated likelihoods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses relative to other methods.},

abstract = {The problem of eliminating nuisance parameters is tackled from different points of view. Standard likelihood techniques, such as profile likelihood and its modifications, are compared with a Bayesian analysis based on reference priors (Berger & Bernardo, 1992a). Examples are considered to illustrate what happens in multiparameter problems. In particular the frequentist coverage probabilities of the credible sets derived from the reference priors are shown to be better than those computed from a likelihood approach. Advantages and disadvantages of Bayesian and likelihood analyses are discussed.},

abstract = {Eliminating nuisance parameters from a model is universally recognized as a major problem of statistics. A surprisingly large number of elimination methods have been proposed by various writers on the topic. In this article we propose to critically review two such elimination methods. We shall be concerned with some particular cases of the marginalizing and the conditioning methods. The origin of these methods may be traced to the work of Sir Ronald A. Fisher. The contents of the marginalization and the conditionality arguments are then reexamined from the Bayesian point of view. This article should be regarded as a sequel to the author's three-part essay (Basu 1975) on statistical information and likelihood.},

abstract = {We propose a new integrated likelihood based approach for estimating panel data models when the unobserved individual effects enter the model nonlinearly. Unlike existing integrated likelihoods in the literature, the one we propose is closer to a genuine likelihood. Although the statistical theory for the proposed estimator is developed in an asymptotic setting where the number of individuals and the number of time periods both approach infinity, results from a simulation study suggest that our methodology can work very well even in moderately sized panels of short duration in both static and dynamic models.}

abstract = {We show why reducing information bias can improve the performance of likelihood based estimators and confidence regions in small samples, and why it seems to matter more for inference than for estimation. The insights in this paper are helpful in explaining several simulation findings in the panel data literature. E.g., we can explain the well documented phenomenon that reducing the score bias alone often reduces the finite sample variance of estimators and improves the coverage of confidence regions in small samples, and why confidence regions based on conditional (on sufficient statistics) likelihoods can have excellent coverage even in very short panels. We can also explain the simulation results in Schumann, Severini, and Tripathi (2021), who find that, in short panels, estimators and confidence regions based on pseudolikelihoods that are simultaneously first-order score and information unbiased perform much better than those based on pseudolikelihoods that are only first-order score unbiased.}
