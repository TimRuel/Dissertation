\section{Assumptions}
Consider a random sample $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ drawn from a population. What can we say about the population based on $\mathbf{x}$? Where is its point of central tendency located? Are its values clustered tightly around this point, or are they more diffuse? Are they distributed symmetrically or skewed to one side or the other? Questions like these were the original motivation behind the field of statistical inference, and many of the techniques devised to answer them are still used by statisticians today.

It is important to remember, however, that the real world is messy and no mathematical function will ever perfectly capture the complexities of a population or random process whose properties we wish to infer. To overcome this difficulty, statisticians sacrifice a small amount of accuracy for a large reduction in complexity by imposing additional assumptions on the population of interest. These assumptions are essentially never "true" in the sense that they are not a flawless representation of reality, but they may nevertheless serve as convenient approximations that are capable of producing answers with degrees of accuracy high enough as to be useful in their own right.

\subsection{Data-Generating Mechanism}

In its most general framework, a statistical model can be formulated as a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P})$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all possible observations (i.e. the population), and $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of probability distributions on $\mathcal{S}$. The first and most fundamental assumption we make when defining our models is that there exists some unknown mechanism in the population that generates the data we observe from $\mathcal{S}$. This mechanism is what induces the "true" probability distribution on $\mathcal{S}$. Out of necessity, we will assume that $\mathcal{P}$ always contains this distribution though in reality there is nothing specifically requiring it.

\subsection{Model Parameterization}

Another assumption found in almost every model is that the set $\mathcal{P}$ is considered to be *parameterized*. That is, we assume there exists a *parameter* $\theta$ that indexes $\mathcal{P}$, acting as a label that allows us to differentiate between the distributions it contains. For a particular value of the parameter $\theta$, say $\theta_1$, we can refer to its corresponding distribution in $\mathcal{P}$ with the notation $\mathcal{P}_{\theta_1}$, and therefore $\mathcal{P}$ itself may be written as $\mathcal{P} = \{\mathcal{P}_{\theta} | \> \theta \in \Theta\}$. $\Theta$ is called the *parameter space* and represents the set of all possible values $\theta$ can take on. 

We can think of the parameter as acting like a tuning dial for the population - rotate the dial and certain behaviors of the population (e.g. its location, scale, or shape) will change. Much of statistical inference can be boiled down to figuring out the particular value to which a population's dial has been set. For a given population, we will assume that a true parameter value does always exist and is contained in $\Theta$. Let the symbol $\theta_0$ denote this value.^[The difference between $\theta_0$ and $\theta$ is subtle but important. $\theta_0$ is a fixed but unknown constant that represents the value of the parameter corresponding to the "true" distribution in $\mathcal{P}$. $\theta$ represents an arbitrary element taken from the space of all possible parameter values, $\Theta$.] Note that $\theta_0$ may change over time depending on the population. In such cases, any estimate of $\theta_0$ based on a cross-sectional sample drawn from the population is best thought of as an estimate of the true parameter value during the particular time in which the sample was collected.

In general, a model's parameterization is not unique, and for any parameter $\theta$, we may choose any one-to-one function of $\theta$ as a new parameter.

\subsection{Identifiability}

Statisticians also like to assume the parameters in their models can be uniquely identified based on the data they observe. A model is considered *identifiable* if having perfect knowledge of the population enables us to determine the true value of its parameter with absolute certainty.^[This is of course almost always impossible in practice, but in theory it could be accomplished by obtaining an infinite number of observations from $\mathcal{S}$ or simply all of its observations if $|\mathcal{S}|$ is finite.] More formally, for any two parameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ in $\Theta$, if $\mathcal{P}_{\theta_1} = \mathcal{P}_{\theta_2}$, then it must follow that $\theta_1 = \theta_2$. A model that is not identifiable could potentially have two or more distinct parameter values that give rise to the same probability distribution. For example, suppose $X$ is distributed uniformly on the interval $(0, \alpha + \beta)$, for two numbers $\alpha, \beta > 0$. If we use $\theta = (\alpha, \beta)$ as a parameter for the distribution of $X$, then $\theta$ is unidentifiable since, for instance, if $\theta_1 = (0, 1)$ and $\theta_1 = (1, 0)$ then $\mathcal{P}_{\theta_1} = \mathcal{P}_{\theta_2}$ despite the fact that $\theta_1 \neq \theta_2$. This is obviously an undesirable property for a model to possess, and so we will restrict our attention solely to identifiable models in this paper as a means of avoiding it.

\subsection{Parameter Space Dimension}

The dimension of the parameter space $\Theta$ is another critical decision statisticians must make when choosing the best model for their research. When $\Theta \subseteq V$, where $V$ is an infinite-dimensional space, the model is said to be a *nonparametric*. The name is a bit of a misnomer in the sense that nonparametric models do not actually lack parameters, but rather they are flexible regarding the exact number and properties of the parameters they do have. 

*Semiparametric* models are those whose parameter spaces have components of both finite and infinite dimensionality. That is, $\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k \times V$, where again $V$ is an infinite-dimensional space. Usually it is only the finite-dimensional component of the parameter in which we are interested while the infinite-dimensional component is considered a nuisance parameter.

Models for which $\Theta$ is of finite dimension are called *parametric*. That is, $\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. This is the most common type of model used by statisticians, with examples including the normal family of distributions as well as the Poisson family. For the purposes of this paper, we will assume all statistical models under discussion are parametric in form.

\section{The Likelihood Function}

Once we have chosen a model $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P})$, our goal becomes to identify the "true" distribution in $\mathcal{P}$ or, failing that, the one that best approximates the truth. Since we have assumed our model is parametric and identifiable, this is equivalent to making inferences about the value of the $k$-dimensional parameter $\theta$ indexing the distributions in $\mathcal{P}$ on the basis of some data we observe. Classically, these inferences come in the form of point estimates, interval estimates, or hypothesis tests though other techniques exist as well. A sensible choice to use as an estimate for the value of $\theta$ is one which causes the data actually observed to have the highest possible *post-hoc* probability of occurrence out of all possible values in $\Theta$. To formalize this notion, we need some way of analyzing the joint probability of our sample as a function of our parameter $\theta$. 

\subsection{The Discrete Case}

Suppose X is a discrete random variable with frequency function $p(x; \theta)$. For a given sample $X = x$, the *likelihood function* for $\theta$ is defined as
$$L(\theta) \equiv L(\theta; x) = p(x; \theta), \> \> \theta \in \Theta.$${#eq-likelihood_single} 
That is, when our sample consists only of a single observation, the likelihood function for $\theta$ is simply equal to $p(x;\theta)$ itself. However, while $p(x; \theta)$ is viewed as a function of $x$ for fixed $\theta$, the reverse is actually true for $L(\theta; x)$; we view it as a function of $\theta$ for fixed $x$. The positioning of the arguments $\theta$ and $x$ is a reflection of this difference in perspectives.

In this case, we may interpret $L(\theta)$ as the probability that $X = x$ given that $\theta$ is the true parameter value. Crucially, this is *not* equivalent to the inverse probability that $\theta$ is the true parameter value given $X = x$. Though intuitively appealing, this interpretation constitutes a fundamental misunderstanding of what a likelihood function is, and great care must be taken to avoid it. 

\subsection{The Continuous Case}

When $X$ is instead a continuous random variable, the likelihood for $\theta$ may still be defined as it is in @eq-likelihood_single. However, $p(x; \theta)$ has switched from being a probability *mass* function to a probability *density* function over the support of $X$. We must therefore forfeit our previous direct interpretation of $L(\theta)$ as a probability since $p(x; \theta)$ no longer represents $\mathbb{P}(X = x | \theta)$. We may however still think of the likelihood as being proportional to the probability that $X$ is "close" to the value $x$.^[Here, "close" means that that $X$ is within a tiny neighborhood of $x$.] Specifically, for two different samples $x_1$ and $x_2$, if $L(\theta; x_1) = c \cdot L(\theta; x_2)$, where $c > 1$, then under this model we may conclude $X$ is $c$ times more likely to assume a value closer to $x_1$ than $x_2$ given that $\theta$ is the true value of the parameter. 

As in the discrete case, we must also be careful here to avoid using $L(\theta)$ to make direct statements of probability about $\theta$. Indeed, despite our use of one in its definition, the likelihood function is *not* itself a probability density over the parameter $\theta$ and need not obey the same laws as one. 

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

Maximum likelihood estimation is one of the most powerful and widespread techniques for obtaining point estimates of model parameters based on some observed data $x$. The original intuition behind the method derives from the observation that when faced with a choice between two possible values of a parameter, say $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, the sensible choice is the one that makes the data we did observe more probable to have been observed. Fortunately, we have already defined the likelihood function as a means of capturing this probability, which makes expressing this decision rule in terms of it very easy - we simply choose for our estimate the option that produces the higher value of the likelihood function. That is, if $L(\theta_1; x) > L(\theta_2; x)$, then $\theta_1$ is the better estimate of the true parameter value and vice versa.

This can be extended to include as many parameter values as we would like. For $n$ potential estimates of the true parameter, the best is the one that corresponds to the highest value of the likelihood function based on the observed data $x$. Taking this logic to its natural conclusion, the *maximum likelihood estimate* (MLE) of the parameter $\theta$, which we will denote by $\hat{\theta}$ (pronounced "theta hat"), is the one that maximizes the value of the likelihood function among all possible choices of $\theta$ in the parameter space $\Theta$. Formally, $$\hat{\theta} = \underset{\theta \in \Theta}{\mathrm{argmax}}\, \> L(\theta; x).$${#eq-mle}

There is no singular method for finding the maximum likelihood estimate of a parameter. However, when the likelihood function is differentiable, it is often possible to calculate the MLE analytically using the derivative test for locating the local maxima of a function. In such cases, the MLE can be found by finding the value of $\theta$ that makes the derivative of the likelihood function with respect to $\theta$ vanish. A popular technique when finding this value is to take the natural logarithm of the likelihood first. This transformation is common enough that it has its own name - the *log-likelihood function*. Formally, it is defined as $$\ell(\theta) \equiv \ell(\theta; x) = \log L(\theta; x), \> \> \theta \in \Theta.$${#eq-loglike} When working with $\ell(\theta)$ instead of $L(\theta)$, any products in the latter have been transformed into sums in the former, making derivative calculations more tractable while still preserving the argument that corresponds to the global maximum, if it exists, of $L(\theta)$.
