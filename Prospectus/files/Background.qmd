\section{Assumptions}

Consider a random sample $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ drawn from a population. What can we say about the population based on $\mathbf{x}$? Where is its point of central tendency located? Are its values clustered tightly around this point, or are they more diffuse? Are they distributed symmetrically or skewed to one side or the other? Questions like these were the original motivation behind the field of statistical inference, and many of the techniques devised to answer them are still used by statisticians today.

It is important to remember, however, that the real world is messy and no mathematical function will ever perfectly capture the complexities of a population or random process whose properties we wish to infer. To overcome this difficulty, statisticians sacrifice a small amount of accuracy for (hopefully) a large reduction in complexity by imposing additional assumptions on the population of interest. These assumptions are essentially never true in the sense that they are not a flawless representation of reality, but they may nevertheless serve as convenient approximations capable of producing sufficiently accurate answers in their own right. As George Box famously put it, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." 

And indeed, in the aggregate these assumptions create what is known as a statistical model. In its most general framework, a statistical model can be formulated as a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P})$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all possible observations (i.e. the population), and $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of probability distributions on $\mathcal{S}$. The first and (in this author's opinion) the most fundamental assumption we make when defining our models is that there exists some unknown mechanism in the population that generates the data we observe from $\mathcal{S}$. This mechanism is what induces the "true" probability distribution on $\mathcal{S}$ though $\mathcal{P}$ need not contain this distribution, and in practice it seldom does. 

Another assumption found in almost every model is that the set $\mathcal{P}$ is considered to be *parameterized*. That is, we assume the probability distributions contained in $\mathcal{P}$ are indexed by a *parameter* that controls their features.^[We will consider the phrases "parameter", "population parameter", and "model parameter" all to have the same meaning in this paper and use them interchangeably.] This parameter acts like a tuning dial for the population - rotate the dial and certain behaviors of the population (e.g. its location, scale, or shape) will change. Much of statistical inference can be boiled down to figuring out the particular value to which a population's dial has been set. We will denote this assumption as $\mathcal{P} = \{\mathcal{P}_{\theta} | \> \theta \in \Theta\}$, where $\theta$ denotes the parameter, and $\Theta$, the parameter space, represents the set of all possible values $\theta$ can take on.^[Note that $\theta$ can be and in fact usually is a multi-dimensional vector whose components represent various sub-parameters of the population.] 

Statisticians also like to assume the parameters in their models can be uniquely identified based on the data they observe. A model is considered *identifiable* if having perfect knowledge of the population enables us to determine the true value of its parameter with absolute certainty.^[This is of course almost always impossible in practice, but in theory it could be accomplished by obtaining an infinite number of observations from $\mathcal{S}$ or simply all of its observations if $|\mathcal{S}|$ is finite.] More formally, for any two parameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ in $\Theta$, if $\mathcal{P}_{\theta_1} = \mathcal{P}_{\theta_2}$, then it must follow that $\theta_1 = \theta_2$. A model that is not identifiable could potentially have two or more distinct parameter values that give rise to the same probability distribution. Since we have already assumed $\mathcal{P}$ is the mechanism generating the data we have observed in the first place, this would make it impossible to determine which value is the "correct" one on the basis of the data alone. Statisticians impose the identifiability criterion on their models as a means of avoiding this undesirable situation.

The dimension of the parameter space $\Theta$ is another critical decision statisticians must make when choosing the best model for their research. The most frequent choice is for $\Theta$ to be of finite dimension. That is, $\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Models that satisfy this assumption are said to be *parametric*. Common examples of parametric models include the normal family of distributions as well as the Poisson family.

In contrast, a *nonparametric model* is one in which $\Theta \subseteq I$, where $I$ is an infinite-dimensional space. The name is a bit of a misnomer in the sense that nonparametric models do not actually lack parameters, but rather they are flexible regarding the exact number and properties of the parameters they do have. \textcolor{red}{[INSERT EXAMPLE(S) OF NONPARAMETRIC MODELS]}

Finally, *semiparametric* models are those whose parameter spaces have components of both finite and infinite dimensionality. That is, $\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k \times I$, where again $I$ is an infinite-dimensional space. Usually it is only the finite-dimensional component of the parameter in which we are interested while the infinite-dimensional component is considered a nuisance parameter. \textcolor{red}{[INSERT EXAMPLE(S) OF SEMIPARAMETRIC MODELS]}


In summary, the reader may safely assume that all models to which my research applies consist of a pair $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P})$ such that the probability distributions in $\mathcal{P}$ are parameterized and identifiable and there exists a "true" probability distribution inducing the data-generating process from $\mathcal{S}$, though this distribution is not necessarily contained in $\mathcal{P}$. In addition, while estimation of the parameters in nonparametric and semiparametric models is also a major topic of interest in statistical inference, I will restrict my attention in my dissertation solely to parametric models. 

\section{The Likelihood Function}

Once we have chosen a model $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P})$, our goal becomes to identify the "true" distribution in $\mathcal{P}$ or, failing that, the one that best approximates the truth. Since we have assumed our model is parametric and identifiable, this is equivalent to making inferences about the value of the $k$-dimensional parameter $\theta$ indexing the distributions in $\mathcal{P}$ on the basis of some data we observe. Classically, these inferences come in the form of point estimates, interval estimates, or hypothesis tests though other techniques exist as well. A sensible choice to use as an estimate for the value of $\theta$ is one which causes the data actually observed to have the highest possible *post-hoc* probability of occurrence out of all possible values in $\Theta$. To formalize this notion, we need some way of analyzing the joint probability of our sample as a function of our parameter $\theta$. 

Suppose the set $\mathcal{S}$ in our model is countable. Then we may think of the observations we draw from $S$ as the outcomes of some discrete random variable $X$. Let $p(x; \theta)$ denote the probability that $X$ takes on the value $x$ under the assumption that $\theta$ is the true parameter value. That is, $p(x; \theta) \equiv \mathbb{P}(X = x \> | \> \theta).$ Then the *likelihood function* for $\theta$ is given by $$L(\theta) \equiv L(\theta; x) = p(x; \theta), \> \> \theta \in \Theta. \tag{1}$$
In other words, the likelihood function evaluated at $\theta$ is equal to the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on the value $x$ given that $\theta$ is the true parameter value. There is a subtle but important distinction in our interpretations of the two quantities, however. While $p(x; \theta)$ is a function of $x$ for fixed $\theta$, the reverse is actually true for $L(\theta; x)$; we view it as a function of $\theta$ for fixed $x$.^[The positioning of the arguments $\theta$ and $x$ is a reflection of this difference in perspectives.] It is crucial to remember that despite our use of probability in its definition a likelihood does not itself represent a probability. For instance, there is no requirement that $\int_{\Theta} L(\theta; x) d\theta = 1$ as would be expected of a probability density function.

If $\mathcal{S}$ is uncountable, then the random variable $X$ generating our observations must instead be continuous. Let us further assume that $X$ admits a probability density function, which we will call $p(x; \theta)$. Lie

\subsection{Nuisance Parameters}

\subsection{Pseudolikelihood Functions}

Nuisance parameters in a statistical model are a serious hindrance to making inferences about the parameter of interest. Consequently, statisticians have dedicated much time to developing techniques that will eliminate them from their models.

If we let $$\Theta(\psi) = \{\theta \in \Theta \> | \> \varphi(\theta) = \psi \},$$ then corresponding to $\psi \in \Psi$ is the set of likelihoods $$\mathcal{L}_{\psi} = \{L(\theta) \> | \> \theta \in \Theta(\psi)\}.$$

Statisticians will often attempt to find a summary of the values in $\mathcal{L}_{\psi}$ that does not depend on $\lambda$. This summary is called a **pseudolikelihood function** and can take several different forms:
    - Maximizing
    - Conditioning
    - Marginalizing*
    - **Integrating**
