We propose an adapted version of a numerical approximation to the integral of a likelihood function with respect to a weight function over the space of its nuisance parameter. In doing so, we illustrate the overall utility of integrated likelihood functions as a method for eliminating nuisance parameters from a likelihood function. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of a statistical model and the various assumptions associated with it. Chapter 2 discusses the properties of the likelihood function and the maximum likelihood estimator. Chapter 3 motivates the use of pseudolikelihood functions as a tool for nuisance parameter elimination and considers the advantages and disadvantages of several types. Chapter 4 focuses on a procedure for approximating integrated likelihood functions that has been adapted from an earlier approximation technique by Severini (2007) based on the construction of a nuisance parameter that is unrelated to the parameter of interest. Chapter 5 gives examples of applications for this procedure.
