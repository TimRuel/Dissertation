\section{Desirable Properties of the Integrated Likelihood}

\subsection{Property 1}

Suppose the likelihood function for a parameter $\theta$ can be decomposed as the product $L(\theta) = L_1(\psi)L_2(\lambda)$. Then the integrated likelihood for $\psi$ should satisfy $$\bar{L}(\psi) = L_1(\psi)$$

\section{The Score Function}

$\ell_{\lambda}(\psi, \lambda)$ is a sub-vector of the vector-valued function $\ell_{\theta}(\theta)$ in which each component is equal to the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to a component of the full model parameter $\theta$. The components of $\ell_{\lambda}$ are the ones from $\ell_{\theta}$ that correspond to the derivatives with respect to the components of $\lambda$.
