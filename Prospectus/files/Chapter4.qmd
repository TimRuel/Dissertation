\section{Model Parameter Decomposition}

It is often the case that we are not interested in estimating the full parameter $\symbf{\theta} \in \symbf{\theta} \subseteq \mathbbm{R}^d$, but rather a different parameter $\psi$ taking values in a set $\Psi \subseteq \mathbbm{R}^p$, where $p < d$. In such an event, we refer to $\psi$ as the *parameter of interest*. Crucially, as we will see, $\psi$ can always be expressed as a function of $\symbf{\theta}$.

Since $\psi$ is of lower dimension than $\symbf{\theta}$, it necessarily follows that there is another parameter $\lambda$, taking values in a set $\Lambda\subseteq{\mathbbm{R}^q}$, where $p + q = d$, that is made up of whatever is "left over" from the full parameter $\symbf{\theta}$. We refer to $\lambda$ as the *nuisance parameter*, so named for its ability to complicate inference regarding the parameter of interest. Despite not being the object of study themselves, nuisance parameters are nevertheless capable of modifying the distributions of our observations and therefore must be accounted for when conducting inference or estimation regarding the parameter of interest.^[Note that nuisance parameters are not always uniquely defined. Depending on the choice of parameter of interest, there may be multiple or even infinite ways to define a nuisance parameter.] The process by which this is accomplished is nontrivial and often represents a serious obstacle that must be overcome. 

While not required, we will assume the parameter of interest $\psi$ is always one-dimensional. That is, $\Psi \subseteq \mathbbm{R}$ and consequently $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbbm{R}^{d-1}$. This restriction reflects the common habit of researchers to focus on scalar-valued summaries of vector quantities. For example, suppose we observe data $Y = (y_1, ..., y_n)$, where each $y_i$ is the outcome of some random variable $Y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2_i)$, and we are interested in estimating the average of the population means, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \mu_i$. Rather than defining $\psi = (\mu_1, ..., \mu_n)$, we can instead define $\psi = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \mu_i$ directly, bypassing the need to estimate each $\mu_i$ individually before taking their average. This does carry the trade-off of increasing the dimension of the nuisance parameter, which must be dealt with before conducting inference or estimation on $\psi$. We will examine some of the issues posed by high-dimensional nuisance parameters in greater detail in the next chapter.

\subsection{Explicit Parameters}

Parameters of interest and nuisance parameters can be broadly classified into two categories, explicit or implicit. For a given statistical model, both types of parameter must occupy the same category - it is not possible for $\psi$ to be explicit and $\lambda$ to be implicit, or vice versa. 

Let us first consider the case in which $\psi$ and $\lambda$ are *explicit* parameters. This means that $\psi$ is a sub-vector of $\symbf{\theta}$, so that all the components of $\psi$ are also components of $\symbf{\theta}$. Then there exists a set $I = \{I_1, ..., I_p\} \subsetneq \{1, ..., d\}$ such that $$\psi = (\symbf{\theta}_{I_1}, ..., \symbf{\theta}_{I_p}).$${#eq-expl_param1} It immediately follows that $\lambda$ is the sub-vector of all components of $\symbf{\theta}$ that are not part of $\psi$. More precisely, if we let $J = \{J_1, ..., J_{q}\} \subsetneq \{1, ..., d\}$ such that $I \cup J = \{1, ..., d\}$ and $I \cap J = \emptyset$, then $$\lambda = (\symbf{\theta}_{J_1}, ..., \symbf{\theta}_{J_q}).$${#eq-expl_param2} $\symbf{\theta}$ can therefore be decomposed as $\symbf{\theta} = (\psi, \lambda)$ when $\psi$ and $\lambda$ are explicit, provided we shuffle the indices appropriately.

\subsection{Implicit Parameters}

Now let us consider the case in which $\psi$ and $\lambda$ are *implicit* parameters. This means there exists some function $\varphi: \symbf{\theta} \to \Psi$ for which the parameter of interest can be written as $$\psi = \varphi(\symbf{\theta}).$${#eq-impl_param} As before, $\Psi$ is still assumed to be a subset of $\mathbbm{R}^p$ where $p$ is less than $d$. This reduction in dimension again implies the existence of a nuisance parameter $\lambda \in \Lambda \subseteq{\mathbbm{R}}^{k-m}$. However, unlike in the explicit case, a closed form expression for $\lambda$ in terms of the original components of $\symbf{\theta}$ need not exist. For this reason, implicit nuisance parameters are in general more difficult to eliminate compared to their explicit counterparts.

Note that when the parameter of interest and nuisance parameter are explicit, it is always possible to define a function $\varphi$ such that $$\varphi(\symbf{\theta}) = (\symbf{\theta}_{I_1}, ..., \symbf{\theta}_{I_p}) = \psi ,$${#eq-expl_param3} where $\{I_1, ..., I_p\}$ is defined as above. Hence, the first case is really just a special example of this more general one in which $\psi = \varphi(\symbf{\theta})$. With this understanding in mind, we will use the notation $\psi = \varphi(\symbf{\theta})$ to refer to the parameter of interest in general, only making the distinction between implicitness and explicitness when the difference is relevant to the situation.

\section{Pseudolikelihood Functions}

\subsection{Definition}

The natural solution to the hindrance nuisance parameters pose to making inferences on the parameter of interest is to find a method for eliminating them from the likelihood function altogether. The result of this elimination is what is known as a pseudolikelihood function.

In general, a *pseudolikelihood function* for $\psi$ is a function of the data and $\psi$ only, having properties resembling that of a genuine likelihood function. Suppose $\psi = \varphi(\symbf{\theta})$ for some function $\phi$ and parameter $\symbf{\theta} \in \Theta$. If we let $\Theta(\psi) = \{\symbf{\theta} \in \Theta  : \> \varphi(\symbf{\theta}) = \psi \},$ then associated with each $\psi \in \Psi$ is the set of likelihoods $\mathcal{L}_{\psi} = \{L(\symbf{\theta}) \> : \> \symbf{\theta} \in \Theta(\psi)\}.$ 

Any summary of the values in $\mathcal{L}_{\psi}$ that does not depend on $\lambda$ theoretically constitutes a pseudolikehood function for $\psi$. There exist a variety of methods to obtain this summary but among the most popular are profiling (maximization), conditioning, and integration, each with respect to the nuisance parameter. None of these summaries come without a cost though, meaning some information about $\psi$ is almost certainly sacrificed whenever a nuisance parameter is eliminated from a likelihood. One measure of a good pseudolikelihood, therefore, is how well it is able to retain information about $\psi$ without becoming overly complex in its computation. 

\subsection{Types of Pseudolikelihoods}

\subsubsection{Profile Likelihoods}

Profile likelihoods are one of the most straightforward methods for eliminating a nuisance parameter $\lambda$ from a likelihood function. The idea is to summarize $L(\psi, \lambda)$ by its maximum value as a function of $\lambda$ for a given value of $\psi$. Formally, it is defined as $$L_p(\psi) = \sup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} L(\psi, \lambda) = L(\hat{\theta}_\psi),$$ where $\hat{\theta}_\psi$ is the MLE of $\symbf{\theta_0}$ for fixed $\psi$. If we define the conditional MLE for $\lambda$ given $\psi$ as the value of $\lambda$ that maximizes the likelihood for a particular value of $\psi$, then we must have $\hat{\theta}_\psi = (\psi, \hat{\lambda}_\psi)$.

Much of the allure of a profile likelihood can be traced to its ease of computation. In the event of a regular model, finding the value of $\hat{\lambda}_\psi$ corresponding to a particular $\psi$ is equivalent to solving a convex optimization problem. Either an analytical solution to this problem will exist or a numerical one can be obtained using modern computational tools. In both cases, $\hat{\lambda}_\psi$ can be found without much trouble, and from there it's just a matter of setting $\lambda = \hat{\lambda}_\psi$ inside $L(\psi, \lambda)$ to obtain $L_p(\psi)$. 

The method is not without its drawbacks however. As @kalbfleisch1970 point out, a major disadvantage to profile likelihoods are their inability to take into account the dimensionality of the nuisance parameter. By effectively always assuming that $\lambda = \hat{\lambda}_{\psi}$, they fail to incorporate any uncertainty we might have in its value into the resulting pseudolikelihood, leading to overly confident estimates of $\psi$. This effect is especially pronounced when the dimension of $\Lambda$ is large.

Nevertheless, a profile likelihood can still be a useful tool for conducting inference regarding $\psi_0$. At worst, it offers a baseline of sorts to assess the quality of other pseudolikelihoods. There is no point in using another pseudolikelihood that is harder to compute if it offers the same amount of information about $\psi_0$ - it must justify this increase in complexity with a corresponding increase in features that lend themselves to a greater degree of accuracy in our inference, such as higher level of peakedness around the value of $\psi_0$.

\subsubsection{Marginal Likelihoods}

For a parameter $\symbf{\theta} = (\psi, \lambda)$, it is sometimes possible to factor the corresponding likelihood function as $$L(\symbf{\theta}) = L_1(\psi)L_2(\psi, \lambda)$$ or even more simply as $$L(\symbf{\theta}) = L_1(\psi)L_2(\lambda).$$ In such cases, the marginal likelihood for $\psi$ is given by $L_M(\psi) = L_1(\psi)$. For instance, suppose we observe some data $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}$ such that the pair of statistics $(\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{X}), \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{X}))$ is sufficient for $\symbf{\theta}$. If the joint density can be factored as $$p(\mathbf{x}; \psi, \lambda) = p_\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{t}; \psi)p_{\mathbf{S}|\mathbf{T}}(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{t}; \psi, \lambda),$$ then we can ignore the second term on the right-hand side of the equation and use $L_M(\psi) = p_\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{t}; \psi)$ as the marginal likelihood for $\psi$.

\subsubsection{Conditional Likelihoods}

\subsubsection{Integrated Likelihoods}

\section{The Bartlett Identities Revisited}

The Bartlett identities offer an alternative way of characterizing the difference between likelihood and pseudolikelihood functions. A genuine likelihood function of $\symbf{\theta}$ can be characterized as any nonnegative random function of $\symbf{\theta}$ for which all of the Bartlett identities hold. Similarly, we can think of a pseudolikelihood function of $\symbf{\theta}$ as behing any nonnegative random function of $\symbf{\theta}$ for which at least one of the Bartlett identities does not hold. Hence, the identities act as a litmus test of sorts for determining the validity of a pseudolikelihood as an approximation to the genuine likelihood from which it originated - the more identities it does satisfy, the better the approximation.
