\section{Introduction}

The research for my dissertation involves developing a novel algorithm for numerically integrating the likelihood function of a statistical model with respect to a nuisance parameter. This prospectus aims to demonstrate how the algorithm works and explain the appeal of using an integrated likelihood function over other types of pseudolikelihood functions to make inferences about the parameter of interest in a model.

\section{Motivation}

The motivation behind my research developed out of the observation that the expression for the integral of a likelihood function follows a form similar to that of the calculation of the marginalizing constant of a posterior distribution.
