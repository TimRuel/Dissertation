\chapter{The Likelihood Function}

\section{Definition}

Upon choosing a statistical model that we think best characterizes our population of interest, the obvious next step is to identify the true distribution in $\mathcal{P}$ or at the very least, the one that best approximates the truth. This is equivalent to making inferences about $\theta_0$ in the case where the model is parametric and identifiable. That is, given the particular form(s) we have chosen for the distributions in $\mathcal{P}$, the only unknown remaining is the value of $\theta_0$ itself. Since this value is ultimately what controls the mechanism generating any sample of data $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ that we might observe from the population, it stands to reason that information regarding $\theta_0$ can be inferred from the specific values of $x_1, ..., x_n$ that we obtain. To make this notion more rigorous, we require some method of analyzing the joint probability of our sample as a function of our parameter $\theta$.

Given some observed data $X = \mathbf{x}$, the *likelihood function* for $\theta$ is defined as $$L(\theta) \equiv L(\theta; \mathbf{x}) = p(\mathbf{x}; \theta), \> \> \theta \in \Theta.$${#eq-likelihood_1} In other words, the value of the likelihood function evaluated at a particular $\theta \in \Theta$ is simply equal to the output of the model's density function evaluated at the same inputs. However, while $p(\mathbf{x}; \theta)$ is viewed primarily as a function of $\mathbf{x}$ for fixed $\theta$, the reverse is actually true for $L(\theta; \mathbf{x})$. Indeed, we regard the likelihood as being a function of the parameter $\theta$ for fixed $\mathbf{x}$. The positioning of the arguments $\theta$ and $x$ is a reflection of this difference in perspectives.

When $X$ is discrete, we may interpret $L(\theta; x)$ as the probability that $X = \mathbf{x}$ given that $\theta$ is the true parameter value. Crucially, this is *not* equivalent to the inverse probability that $\theta$ is the true parameter value given $X = \mathbf{x}$. The likelihood does not directly tell us anything about the probability that $\theta$ assumes any particular value at all. Though intuitively appealing, this interpretation constitutes a fundamental misunderstanding of what a likelihood function is, and great care must be taken to avoid it. 

When $X$ is continuous, the likelihood for $\theta$ may still be defined as it is in @eq-likelihood_1. However, we must forfeit our previous interpretation of $L(\theta)$ as a probability since the probability that $X$ takes on any particular value is now 0. We may however still think of the likelihood as being proportional to the probability that $X$ takes on a value "close" to $x$, meaning that that $X$ is within a tiny neighborhood of $x$. Specifically, for two different samples $x_1$ and $x_2$, if $L(\theta; \mathbf{x}_1) = c \cdot L(\theta; \mathbf{x}_2)$, where $c > 1$, then under this model we may conclude $X$ is $c$ times more likely to assume a value closer to $\mathbf{x}_1$ than $\mathbf{x}_2$ given that $\theta$ is the true value of the parameter. 

As in the discrete case, we must also be careful when $X$ is continuous to avoid using $L(\theta; \mathbf{x})$ to make probability statements about $\theta$. Despite our use of one in its definition, the likelihood is *not* itself a probability density function for the parameter $\theta$ and need not obey the same laws as one. 

\section{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

Maximum likelihood estimation is one of the most powerful and widespread techniques for obtaining point estimates of model parameters. The original intuition behind the method derives from the observation that when faced with a choice between two possible values of a parameter, the sensible choice is the one which makes the data we actually did observe more probable to have been observed. We have already defined the likelihood function as a means of capturing this probability, which makes expressing this decision rule in terms of it very easy - we simply choose for our estimate the option that produces the higher value of the likelihood function. That is, if $L(\theta_1; \mathbf{x}) > L(\theta_2; \mathbf{x})$, then under the preceding logic, $\theta_1$ is the better estimate of the true parameter value.

This can be extended to include as many candidate parameter values as we would like. For $n$ potential estimates of $\theta_0$, the best is the one that corresponds to the highest value of the likelihood function. If we follow this line of reasoning to its natural conclusion, we arrive at the notion of a *maximum likelihood estimate* of the parameter $\theta$, which is defined as any value of $\theta$ that maximizes the output of the likelihood function among all possible choices of $\theta$ in $\Theta$ for fixed data $\mathbf{x}$. We will denote this using the notation $\hat{\theta}$ (pronounced "theta hat"). Formally, a maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$ is defined as a function $\hat{\theta} = \hat{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) \in \Theta$ for which $$L(\hat{\theta}; \mathbf{x}) = \underset{\theta \in \Theta}{\mathrm{sup}}\, \> L(\theta; \mathbf{x}),$${#eq-mle1} or equivalently $$\ell(\hat{\theta}; \mathbf{x}) = \underset{\theta \in \Theta}{\mathrm{sup}}\, \> \ell(\theta; \mathbf{x}).$${#eq-mle2}

In general, there is no guarantee that a maximum likelihood estimate for the parameter of a statistical model will exist, and if it does, it will not necessarily be unique.

\subsection{Transformations}

There are a few useful transformations of the likelihood function that we will define here for use in future sections. The first is the *log-likelihood function*, which is defined as the natural logarithm of the likelihood function: $$\ell(\theta) \equiv \ell(\theta; \mathbf{x}) = \log L(\theta; \mathbf{x}), \> \> \theta \in \Theta.$${#eq-loglike} In practice, we will typically eschew direct analysis of the likelihood in favor of the log-likelihood due to the nice mathematical properties logarithms possess. Chief among these properties is the ability to turn products into sums (i.e. $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$ for $a,b > 0$). Sums tend to be easier to differentiate than products, making this is a particularly useful feature for likelihood functions, which are often expressed as the product of marginal density functions when the observations are independent. 

The other key property of logarithms that makes the log-likelihood so useful is that they are strictly increasing functions of their arguments (i.e. $\log x > \log y$ for $x > y > 0$). This monotonicity ensures that the locations of a function's extrema are preserved when the function is passed to the argument of a logarithm. For example, for a positive function $f$ with a global maximum, $\underset{x}{\mathrm{argmax}} f(x) = \underset{x}{\mathrm{argmax}} \log f(x)$. 

We will refer to the derivatives of $\ell(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta$ with the notation $\ell_{\theta}(\theta) = \nabla \ell(\theta)$, $\ell_{\theta \theta}(\theta) = \nabla^2 \ell(\theta)$, et cetera. Since we will consider the general case in which $\theta$ is a multi-dimensional vector, it follows that $\ell_{\theta}(\theta)$ is also a vector, $\ell_{\theta \theta}(\theta)$ is a matrix, $\ell_{\theta \theta \theta}(\theta)$ is a three-dimensional array, and so forth. 

The first derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $\theta$ appears frequently enough in the analysis of likelihood functions that it has earned its own name - the *score function*. Formally, it is defined as 
$$\mathcal{S}(\theta) \equiv \mathcal{S}(\theta; \mathbf{x}) = \ell_{\theta}(\theta; \mathbf{x}), \> \> \theta \in \Theta.$${#eq-score} 

Similarly, the negative second derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to $\theta$ is called the *observed information*. Formally, it is defined as $$\mathcal{I}(\theta) \equiv \mathcal{I}(\theta; \mathbf{x}) = -\ell_{\theta \theta}(\theta; \mathbf{x}), \> \> \theta \in \Theta.$${#eq-obs_information} The name derives from the fact that it measures the curvature of the log-likelihood around its maximum; the sharper the curve, the less uncertainty we have about $\theta$. 

Note that $\ell(\theta; \mathbf{x})$, $\mathcal{S}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$, and $\mathcal{I}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$ are all functions of the data $\mathbf{x}$ and therefore can be interpreted as random variables themselves with respect to $p(\mathbf{x}; \theta)$. Consequently, quantities such as their expectations and variances are well-defined. In particular, the variance of the score function, known as the *expected information* or the *Fisher information*, is another well-known transformation that will be useful to know. Formally, it is defined as $$\mathscr{I}(\theta) = \mathbb{V}\big[\mathcal{S}(\theta; \mathbf{x}); \theta_0\big], \> \> \theta \in \Theta.$${#eq-exp_information}

\section{Asymptotic Analysis}

\subsection{Regularity Conditions}

Because of their dependency on the data $x_1,..., x_n$, which we interpret as being realizations of random variables $X_1, ..., X_n$, there is a sense in which the maximum likelihood estimate may be interpreted as being a random variable itself. In light of this, it makes sense to investigate how their behavior is related to $n$, the number of observations in the sample. Of particular interest is the distribution to which the maximum likelihood estimate converges as $n$ tends toward infinity, if indeed one exists. To that end, it will be useful to establish some *regularity conditions* for our models. We can think of these conditions as being assumptions similar to those we discussed in the introduction to this paper that, when satisfied, endow our models with certain properties. 

For our purposes, we will call a model *regular* if it satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[label = RC\arabic*)]
  \item The observations $x_1, ..., x_n$ are realizations of i.i.d. random variables $X_1, ..., X_n$ each with density function $p(x; \theta)$.
  \item The parameter space $\Theta$ is a convex set.
  \item $\mathbb{E}\Big(\big[\mathcal{S}(\theta;x)\big]\big[\mathcal{S}(\theta;x)\big]^T; \theta\Big)$ is positive definite for all $\theta \in \Theta$.
  \item There exists an open set $\Theta^* \subseteq \Theta$ of which $\theta_0$ is an interior point.
  \item $p(x; \theta)$ is twice continuously differentiable with respect to $\theta$ for all $\theta \in \Theta^*$.
  \item The set $\{x \in \mathbb{R}: p(x; \theta) > 0\}$ does not depend on $\theta$.
  \item There exists a function $M(x)$ such that $\mathbb{E}[M(X); \theta_0] < \infty$, and each component of $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\mathcal{S}(\theta;x)$ is bounded in absolute value by $M(x)$ uniformly for all $\theta$ in a neighborhood $N_r(\theta_0) \subseteq \Theta^*$.
\end{enumerate}

RC1) is included merely to simplify calculations and frame our discussion in the context of a standard case in which likelihood theory holds. RC2-3) guarantee that it is always possible to solve the likelihood equation for $\hat{\theta}$. RC4-6) ensure that there is no issue with defining derivatives of the log-likelihood function. Finally, RC7) implies that first and second partial derivatives with respect to $\theta$ may be passed under the integral sign in $\int p(x; \theta) dx$, and that the remainder term in the Taylor series expansion of the score function centered at $\theta_0$ is negligible.

\subsection{Single-Index Asymptotic Theory}

Single-index asymptotic theory describes the behavior of likelihood-based statistics as the sample size ($n$) grows to infinity while the dimension of the nuisance parameter ($m$) remains fixed. The aim of this section is to present a basic overview of the theory's results so that the reader will have a readily available baseline against which to compare the results of the following section discussing two-index asymptotic theory, in which the dimension of the nuisance parameter is allowed to increase with the sample size.

Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be IID random variables with density function $p(\mathbf{x}; \theta)$ and let $\hat{\theta}$ denote the maximum likelihood estimate for $\theta_0$ based on the observed values $x_1, ..., x_n$. The traditional method for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of $\hat{\theta}$ is to use a first-order Taylor series expansion of the score function.^[See Appendix \ref{appendix:A} for a review of Taylor's theorem and the conditions under which it is satisfied.] 

To do this, first note that the likelihood function for $\theta$ based on $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ is $$L(\theta; \mathbf{x}) \equiv p(\mathbf{x}; \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i; \theta).$$ We may therefore write the log-likelihood function as 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell(\theta; \mathbf{x}) &= \log L(\theta; \mathbf{x}) \\
                         &= \log p(\mathbf{x}; \theta) \\
                         &= \log\Bigg[ \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i; \theta)\Bigg] \\
                         &= \sum_{i=1}^n \log p(x_i; \theta) \\
                         &= \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(\theta; x_i).
\end{aligned}
$$
It follows that the score function can be written as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{S}(\theta; \mathbf{x}) &= \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \ell(\theta; \mathbf{x}) \\
             &= \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(\theta; x_i) \\
             &= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \ell(\theta; x_i) \\
             &= \sum_{i=1}^n \mathcal{S}(\theta; x_i).
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-score_additive}
In other words, the score function for the parameter $\theta$ based on data $x_1, ..., x_n$ can be written as the sum of individual contributions $\mathcal{S}(\theta; x_i)$, $i = 1,..., n$, where each $\mathcal{S}(\theta; x_i)$ is the score function for $\theta$ based only on observation $x_i$. Note that these individual contributions are all independent from one another, a consequence of our earlier assumption that the observations themselves are independent.

@eq-score_additive implies that a Taylor series expansion of $\mathcal{S}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$ will be equal to the sum of the Taylor series expansions of its individual contributions, plus a remainder term that grows with $n$. We have assumed each $x_i$ is identically distributed, so it suffices to consider the expansion for an arbitrary contribution, $\mathcal{S}(\theta; x_i)$.

Since $\theta$ is a vector, the $k$-th derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $\theta$ will be a $k$-dimensional array having $d$ entries along each of its $k$ indices. In particular, the score function (i.e. the first derivative of the log-likelihood) will be a $d \times 1$ vector, $$\mathcal{S}(\theta; x_i) = \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{S}_1(\theta; x_i) \\ \vdots \\ \mathcal{S}_d(\theta; x_i) \end{pmatrix},$$ where each component is a function $S_j: \Theta \to \mathbb{R}$. Similarly, the first and second derivatives of the score function will be a $d \times d$ matrix and a three-dimensional $d \times d \times d$ array, respectively. To simplify notation, we will perform a componentwise Taylor series expansion of the score function around the point $\theta = \theta_0$ wherein each component $S_j(\theta; x_i)$ of $S(\theta; x_i)$ is expanded separately.



Assume that the regularity conditions established in Section 1.2.2 apply to our model.^[Since it is the score function that we are expanding, we will phrase our references to the regularity conditions from Section 1.2.2 with respect to it, without making direct mention of the density or log-likelihood functions in terms of which the conditions were originally framed. For example, referring to the third derivative of the log-likelihood is equivalent to referring to the second derivative of the score; we will use only the latter phrasing and not the former in this section.] Conditions C2) and C3) stipulate that there exists an open subset $\Theta^* \subseteq \Theta$ containing $\theta_0$ for which $S_j(\theta; x_i)$ is twice continuously differentiable with respect to $\theta$ for all $\theta \in \Theta^*$. C5) requires that the components of the second derivative of the score function are all bounded (with probability 1) by a random function $M(\mathbf{x})$ with finite expectation for all $N_r(\theta_0)$. Together, these conditions satisfy the necessary requirements to apply Taylor's theorem with the Lagrange form of the remainder term to the score function. Hence, for all $\theta \in N_r(\theta_0)$, the first order Taylor series expansion of $S_j(\theta; x_i)$ around $\theta_0$ is given by $$T_j(\theta; x_i) = S_j(\theta_0; x_i) + \nabla S_j(\theta_0; x_i)^T(\theta - \theta_0) + R(\theta),$$ where the remainder term $R(\theta)$ satisfies $$|R(\theta)| \leq \frac{M(\mathbf{x})}{\symbf\alpha!}|\theta - \theta_0|^{\symbf{\alpha}}$$ for all $\symbf{\alpha}$ such that $|\symbf{\alpha}| = 2.$

\subsection{Two-Index Asymptotic Theory}

Two-index asymptotic theory describes the behavior of likelihood functions as the sample size and dimension of the nuisance parameter both tend to infinity, with $m$ growing at least as fast as $n$. De Bin (2015)
