## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Suppose we are interested in estimating the weighted sum of a group of Poisson means corresponding to $n$ independent populations, where $n$ is a known positive integer. Let $X_i$ denote the Poisson random variable modeling the $i$th population with associated parameter $\text{E}(X_i) = \text{V}(X_i) = \theta_i$, $i = 1, ..., n$. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for $\theta_i$ is simply $\hat{\theta}_i = x_i$, the observed value of $X_i$. Consider the weighted sum $$Y = \sum_{i=1}^n w_iX_i,$$ where each $w_i$ is a known constant greater than zero. The purpose of this paper is to consider likelihood- and pseudolikelihood-based inference for the real-valued parameter of interest $$\psi \equiv \text{E}(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i\theta_i.$$ In particular, we will analyze the performance of point and inverval estimates for $\psi$ based on the integrated likelihood function and a proposed modification to it. Similar estimates obtained from the profile likelihood will be used as a benchmark.
