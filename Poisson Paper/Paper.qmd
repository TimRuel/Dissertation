## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Suppose the random variables $N_i$, $i = 1, ..., m,$ each have independent Poisson distributions such that $\text{E}(N_i) = \theta_i$ and $\theta = (\theta_1, ..., \theta_m) \in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^m_+$. The purpose of this paper is to consider likelihood-based inference for a real-valued parameter of interest $\psi = g(\theta)$, where $g: \Theta \to \Psi$ is a known twice continuously differentiable function.

The log-likelihood function of the model is given by 

$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^m \big[N_i \log(\theta_i) - \theta_i\big].
$${#eq-1}
Note that while $\ell$ is a function of the full $m$-dimensional vector parameter $\theta$, $\psi$ is just a scalar. This reduction in dimension induces a nuisance parameter $\lambda$ in the model that typically must be eliminated from the log-likelihood function before inference regarding $\psi$ can be conducted. The standard procedure for doing so involves choosing some method with which to summarize $\ell(\theta)$ over its possible values while holding $\psi$ fixed in place. In the general case where both $\psi$ and $\lambda$ are defined implicitly (i.e. $\psi$ isn't just equal to one of the components of $\theta$), this effectively reduces $\ell(\theta)$ to a simple function of $\psi$ alone, having replaced each dimension of $\theta$ that depends on $\lambda$ with a static summary of its range of values. We call this new function a pseudo-log-likelihood function for $\psi$ and denote it as $\ell(\psi)$.

Perhaps the most straightforward method of summarization we can use to construct $\ell(\psi)$ is to maximize $\ell(\theta)$ over all possible of values of $\theta$ for a fixed value of $\psi$. This yields what is known as the *profile* log-likelihood function, formally defined as 
$$
\ell_p(\psi) = \sup_{\theta \in \Theta: \> g(\theta) = \psi} \ell(\theta).

## Integrated Likelihood Functions

## Application to Poisson Models

We now turn our attention to the task of using the ZSE parameterization to construct an integrated likelihood that can be used to make inferences regarding a parameter of interest derived from the Poisson model described in the introduction. We will 

## Inference for the Weighted Sum of Poisson Means

## Examples


Suppose we are interested in estimating the weighted sum of a group of Poisson means corresponding to $n$ independent populations, where $n$ is a known positive integer.  Note that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for $\theta_i$ is simply $\hat{\theta}_i = x_i$, the observed value of $X_i$. Consider the weighted sum $$Y = \sum_{i=1}^n w_iX_i,$$ where each $w_i$ is a known constant greater than zero. 


The purpose of this paper is to consider likelihood- and pseudolikelihood-based inference for the real-valued parameter of interest $$\psi \equiv \text{E}(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i\theta_i.$$ In particular, we will analyze the performance of point and inverval estimates for $\psi$ based on the integrated likelihood function and a proposed modification to it. Similar estimates obtained from the profile likelihood will be used as a benchmark.
